# **üèéÔ∏è F1 Racing Simulator: A Programming Challenge**  

## **Overview**  
In this programming challenge, you will simulate the behavior of Formula 1 (F1) cars in a race. You will design well-structured classes, read car data from a file, and implement a simple race simulation using object-oriented principles. Additionally, you will be encouraged to think creatively about how to make the simulation more engaging and realistic.  

This project will help you master:  
‚úÖ **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**  
‚úÖ **Designing Well-Structured Classes**  
‚úÖ **Programming Creatively**

## **Exercise 1: Understanding F1 Car Data Formats üìÑ**  
Before we start coding, let's analyze how F1 car data can be stored in a file.  

1. Research different file formats (CSV, JSON, etc.) and determine which format is best for storing F1 car data.  
2. Given the following sample `cars.txt` file in CSV format:  

   ```
   car_name,max_speed,acceleration,handling
   Ferrari F1-75,340,3.2,85
   Red Bull RB18,345,3.0,90
   Mercedes W13,335,3.1,88
   ```

   - What information does each column represent?  
   - How can this data be used to create F1 car objects in Java?  

3. Discuss how handling errors (e.g., missing values, incorrect formats) is important when reading data from files.  

üí° **Hint:** Think about how you would parse this file in Java using `BufferedReader` or `Scanner`.  

---

## **Exercise 2: Designing the F1 Car Class üèÅ**  
Now, let's design a Java class to represent an F1 car.  

### **Task:**  
1. Identify the key attributes of an F1 car based on the `cars.txt` file (e.g., `name`, `maxSpeed`, `acceleration`, `handling`).  
2. Define a **class blueprint** for an `F1Car` in Java. Your class should include:  
   - Private attributes to store car properties.  
   - A constructor to initialize an F1 car using values from a file.  
   - Getters and setters for accessing/modifying attributes.  
   - A `toString()` method to print car details in a readable format.  

### **Example Scaffolding:**  
```java
public class F1Car {
    private String name;
    private int maxSpeed;
    private double acceleration;
    private int handling;

    public F1Car(String name, int maxSpeed, double acceleration, int handling) {
        this.name = name;
        this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
        this.acceleration = acceleration;
        this.handling = handling;
    }

    // Getters, setters, and toString() method here
}
```

3. How does encapsulation help in designing this class?

## **Exercise 3: Reading Car Data from a File üìÇ**  
Now that we have an `F1Car` class, let's instantiate car objects by reading data from `cars.txt`.  

### **Task:**  
1. Implement a method that reads car data from `cars.txt`, parses each line, and creates `F1Car` objects.  
2. Store these objects in a `List<F1Car>` for easy access.  
3. Handle potential errors such as:  
   - **File not found** errors.  
   - **Incorrect data formatting** (e.g., missing values or invalid numbers).  

### **Example Scaffolding:**  
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class F1CarReader {
    public static List<F1Car> readCarsFromFile(String filename) {
        List<F1Car> cars = new ArrayList<>();

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
            String line;
            br.readLine(); // Skip header
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] parts = line.split(",");
                if (parts.length == 4) {
                    String name = parts[0];
                    int maxSpeed = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
                    double acceleration = Double.parseDouble(parts[2]);
                    int handling = Integer.parseInt(parts[3]);

                    cars.add(new F1Car(name, maxSpeed, acceleration, handling));
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException | NumberFormatException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        return cars;
    }
}
```

4. Test your method by printing out all F1 cars read from the file.

## **Exercise 4: Implementing a Simple Race Simulation üèéÔ∏èüí®**  
Now, let's simulate an F1 race using the cars we loaded.  

### **Task:**  
1. Write a method that simulates a **drag race** between two F1 cars.  
2. The winner is determined based on acceleration and max speed.  
3. Consider adding randomness to make the race more dynamic (e.g., weather conditions affecting handling).  

### **Example Scaffolding:**  
```java
public class RaceSimulator {
    public static void race(F1Car car1, F1Car car2) {
        double car1Time = 100 / (car1.getAcceleration() * car1.getMaxSpeed());
        double car2Time = 100 / (car2.getAcceleration() * car2.getMaxSpeed());

        System.out.println(car1.getName() + " finished in " + car1Time + " seconds");
        System.out.println(car2.getName() + " finished in " + car2Time + " seconds");

        if (car1Time < car2Time) {
            System.out.println(car1.getName() + " wins!");
        } else {
            System.out.println(car2.getName() + " wins!");
        }
    }
}
```

4. Modify the formula to consider handling as a factor in the race.  

---

## **Exercise 5: Creating a Full Race Circuit Simulation üèÜ**  
Expand your simulation by creating a **multi-lap race** with multiple cars.  

### **Task:**  
1. Implement a `RaceTrack` class that:  
   - Takes a list of `F1Car` objects.  
   - Simulates multiple laps (each lap time is influenced by speed, acceleration, and handling).  
   - Determines the **final winner** based on total race time.  
2. Add randomness (e.g., "rain reduces handling by 10%").  

üí° **Hint:** Use a loop to simulate multiple laps, updating each car‚Äôs total time.  

---

## **Exercise 6: Adding Creativity & Enhancements üé®**  
Now, let‚Äôs make the simulation more fun!  

### **Task:**  
1. Add **overtaking logic**: If a car is close in time to the one ahead, it has a chance to overtake based on handling.  
2. Implement **pit stops**: Some cars may need pit stops, which add a delay but slightly increase performance.  
3. Display a **graph

# **üèéÔ∏è F1 Racing Simulator: Exercises 1 & 2**  

## **Exercise 1: Understanding F1 Car Data Formats üìÑ**  
Before we start coding, let's analyze how F1 car data can be stored in a file and how it can be extracted for use in a program.  

### **Task 1: Exploring File Formats**  
Research different file formats commonly used for storing structured data, such as **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**, **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**, and **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**. Answer the following questions:  
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of each format in the context of reading car data for a simulation?  
- Why is **CSV** commonly used for storing simple tabular data like F1 car specifications?  

### **Task 2: Analyzing Car Data Structure**  
Given the following **CSV-formatted** `cars.txt` file:  
```
car_name,max_speed,acceleration,handling
Ferrari F1-75,340,3.2,85
Red Bull RB18,345,3.0,90
Mercedes W13,335,3.1,88
```  

- What does each column represent in the context of an F1 car simulation?  
- How would you map this data into a **Java class**?  

### **Task 3: Handling Errors in File Reading**  
When reading files, errors can occur, such as:  
- **Missing values** (e.g., a car entry missing its max speed).  
- **Incorrect formats** (e.g., a non-numeric value in a numeric column).  
- **File not found** errors.  

**Question:** What strategies can be used to handle these errors in Java? Consider exception handling techniques such as try-catch blocks and data validation checks.  

üí° **Hint:** Think about how you would **parse** this file in Java using `BufferedReader` or `Scanner` and how you would **handle errors gracefully**.  

---

## **Exercise 2: Designing the F1 Car Class üèÅ**  
Now, let‚Äôs design a structured Java class to represent an **F1 car** using **object-oriented principles**.  

### **Task 1: Identifying Key Attributes**  
Based on the `cars.txt` file format, identify the **essential properties** of an `F1Car` object. Consider attributes such as:  
- `name` (String) ‚Äì The car's model name.  
- `maxSpeed` (int) ‚Äì The car's top speed in km/h.  
- `acceleration` (double) ‚Äì How quickly the car reaches top speed (lower is better).  
- `handling` (int) ‚Äì A value representing the car‚Äôs ability to take turns smoothly.  

### **Task 2: Designing the Class Structure**  
Write a **high-level description** of how you would design the `F1Car` class. Your class should include:  
- **Private fields** for encapsulation.  
- **A constructor** to initialize an F1 car object.  
- **Getter and setter methods** for accessing/modifying attributes.  
- **A `toString()` method** to format car details as a readable string.  

### **Task 3: The Importance of Encapsulation**  
Encapsulation ensures **data integrity** by restricting direct access to object attributes.  

- **Question:** Why is it important to make fields `private` and provide `getter` and `setter` methods instead of making them `public`?  
- **Question:** How does encapsulation help in managing and maintaining larger projects?  

üí° **Hint:** Think about how encapsulation prevents **accidental modifications** to critical data and allows controlled updates.

These exercises set the foundation for implementing the F1 car simulation by helping students understand **file data structures**, **class design**, and **object-oriented principles** before diving into coding. üöÄ

# **üèéÔ∏è F1 Racing Simulator: Exercises 3 & 4**  

## **Exercise 3: Reading Car Data from a File üìÇ**  
Now that you have designed the `F1Car` class, it's time to **instantiate F1 car objects dynamically** by reading data from a file. This exercise will focus on **file I/O operations**, **parsing CSV data**, and **handling potential errors gracefully**.  

---

### **Task 1: Implementing a Car Data Reader**  
Write a Java method to **read the `cars.txt` file** and create `F1Car` objects.  

1. Open the file using a `BufferedReader`.  
2. Read each line, **skip the header**, and extract values.  
3. Convert numeric values (`maxSpeed`, `acceleration`, `handling`) into appropriate data types.  
4. Instantiate an `F1Car` object for each line and store it in a `List<F1Car>`.  

### **Example Scaffolding:**  
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class F1CarReader {
    public static List<F1Car> readCarsFromFile(String filename) {
        List<F1Car> cars = new ArrayList<>();

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
            String line;
            br.readLine(); // Skip header
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] parts = line.split(",");
                if (parts.length == 4) {
                    String name = parts[0];
                    int maxSpeed = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
                    double acceleration = Double.parseDouble(parts[2]);
                    int handling = Integer.parseInt(parts[3]);

                    cars.add(new F1Car(name, maxSpeed, acceleration, handling));
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException | NumberFormatException e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        return cars;
    }
}
```

---

### **Task 2: Handling Potential Errors**  
When reading files, errors may occur. Modify your method to handle the following:  

- **File not found**: Display a user-friendly message if the file doesn‚Äôt exist.  
- **Incorrect data formats**: If a line contains an invalid number, skip it and continue reading.  
- **Missing values**: If a row has missing data, log a warning and skip that car.  

üí° **Hint:** Use `try-catch` blocks to catch `IOException`, `NumberFormatException`, and other potential exceptions.  

---

### **Task 3: Testing Your Implementation**  
1. Create a `main` method that calls `readCarsFromFile()` and prints all cars loaded from the file.  
2. Ensure your program works with a correctly formatted file and gracefully handles errors.  

**Example Output:**  
```
Ferrari F1-75: Max Speed = 340 km/h, Acceleration = 3.2s, Handling = 85
Red Bull RB18: Max Speed = 345 km/h, Acceleration = 3.0s, Handling = 90
Mercedes W13: Max Speed = 335 km/h, Acceleration = 3.1s, Handling = 88
```

---

## **Exercise 4: Implementing a Simple Race Simulation üèéÔ∏èüí®**  
Now that we have a list of `F1Car` objects, let‚Äôs simulate a **basic drag race** between two cars. This exercise will introduce **basic game logic**, **calculations based on car attributes**, and **randomness** to make the race more dynamic.  

---

### **Task 1: Implementing a Race Logic**  
Write a method that simulates a **drag race** between two F1 cars.  

1. The race is a **100m sprint**, and the winner is determined by the **car that completes the distance in the shortest time**.  
2. The formula for time can be:  
   ```
   time = 100 / (acceleration * maxSpeed)
   ```
   - A **higher acceleration** (lower value) results in a faster car.  
   - A **higher max speed** contributes to a lower race time.  
3. Print the race times of both cars and declare the **winner**.  

### **Example Scaffolding:**  
```java
public class RaceSimulator {
    public static void race(F1Car car1, F1Car car2) {
        double car1Time = 100 / (car1.getAcceleration() * car1.getMaxSpeed());
        double car2Time = 100 / (car2.getAcceleration() * car2.getMaxSpeed());

        System.out.println(car1.getName() + " finished in " + car1Time + " seconds");
        System.out.println(car2.getName() + " finished in " + car2Time + " seconds");

        if (car1Time < car2Time) {
            System.out.println(car1.getName() + " wins!");
        } else {
            System.out.println(car2.getName() + " wins!");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Task 2: Incorporating Handling into the Race**  
Modify the formula to **include handling as a factor**. A car with better handling should have a slight advantage in race performance.  

üí° **Hint:** You can adjust the formula by factoring in handling as a percentage-based bonus.  

Example modification:  
```
time = 100 / (acceleration * maxSpeed * (1 + handling/100))
```

---

### **Task 3: Making the Race More Dynamic**  
Enhance your race simulation by adding **random environmental factors**:  

1. **Weather conditions**:  
   - If it's **rainy**, reduce handling by **10%**.  
   - If it's **sunny**, increase max speed by **5 km/h**.  

2. **Random performance fluctuations**:  
   - Introduce a small **random variation** in car performance (e.g., `¬±5%` time change).  

üí° **Hint:** Use `Random` in Java to generate random numbers for weather conditions and fluctuations.  

---

### **Task 4: Running the Simulation**  
1. Modify your `main` method to:  
   - Read cars from `cars.txt`.  
   - Allow the user to **select two cars** for a race.  
   - Simulate a race and display the **winner**.  

2. Example **User Interaction Flow:**  
```
Available Cars:
1. Ferrari F1-75
2. Red Bull RB18
3. Mercedes W13

Select two cars to race (enter two numbers): 1 2

Simulating race...
Ferrari F1-75 finished in 5.4 seconds
Red Bull RB18 finished in 5.2 seconds

üèÜ Red Bull RB18 wins! üèÜ
```

---

## **Summary of Learning Goals Covered**  

‚úÖ **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**  
- Implemented file reading using `BufferedReader`.  
- Parsed structured data into `F1Car` objects.  
- Hand

# **üèéÔ∏è F1 Racing Simulator: Exercises 5 & 6**  

## **Exercise 5: Creating a Full Race Circuit Simulation üèÜ**  
Now that you have implemented a simple drag race, it's time to **expand** your simulation into a full-fledged **multi-lap race circuit** involving multiple cars. This exercise focuses on **object-oriented programming**, **loops and conditionals**, and **randomized race conditions** to make the simulation more dynamic and engaging.

### **Task 1: Designing the `RaceTrack` Class**  
Create a `RaceTrack` class that manages a **multi-lap race** with multiple cars. The class should:  
1. **Store a list of `F1Car` objects** that are participating in the race.  
2. **Define the number of laps** (e.g., 5 laps).  
3. **Simulate each lap**, updating each car‚Äôs race time based on its attributes.  
4. **Determine the final winner** based on total race time.  

üìå **Considerations for the Race Simulation:**  
- **Lap time calculation**: Each lap‚Äôs time should be influenced by a car‚Äôs **speed, acceleration, and handling**.  
- **Random weather effects**: Rain reduces handling by **10%**, while strong winds increase lap time by **5%**.  
- **Overtaking logic**: If a car is close in time to the one ahead, it has a chance to **overtake** based on handling.  

---

### **Task 2: Implementing the `RaceTrack` Class**  
#### **Example Scaffolding:**  
```java
import java.util.*;

public class RaceTrack {
    private List<F1Car> cars;
    private int laps;
    private Random random;

    public RaceTrack(List<F1Car> cars, int laps) {
        this.cars = cars;
        this.laps = laps;
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public void startRace() {
        Map<F1Car, Double> raceTimes = new HashMap<>();

        for (F1Car car : cars) {
            raceTimes.put(car, 0.0); // Initialize total times
        }

        for (int lap = 1; lap <= laps; lap++) {
            System.out.println("Lap " + lap + " begins!");

            for (F1Car car : cars) {
                double lapTime = calculateLapTime(car);
                raceTimes.put(car, raceTimes.get(car) + lapTime);

                System.out.println(car.getName() + " completed lap in " + String.format("%.2f", lapTime) + " seconds.");
            }

            System.out.println("---------------------");
        }

        declareWinner(raceTimes);
    }

    private double calculateLapTime(F1Car car) {
        double baseTime = 100 / (car.getAcceleration() * car.getMaxSpeed());
        double handlingFactor = 1 - (car.getHandling() / 100.0);

        // Apply random weather effects
        double weatherEffect = random.nextDouble() < 0.3 ? 1.1 : 1.0; // 30% chance of rain

        return baseTime * handlingFactor * weatherEffect;
    }

    private void declareWinner(Map<F1Car, Double> raceTimes) {
        F1Car winner = null;
        double bestTime = Double.MAX_VALUE;

        for (Map.Entry<F1Car, Double> entry : raceTimes.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() < bestTime) {
                bestTime = entry.getValue();
                winner = entry.getKey();
            }
        }

        System.out.println("\nüèÜ Race Winner: " + winner.getName() + " with a total time of " + String.format("%.2f", bestTime) + " seconds! üèÜ");
    }
}
```

---

### **Task 3: Running the Full Race Simulation**  
1. Modify your `main` method to:  
   - Read cars from `cars.txt`.  
   - Allow the user to **select multiple cars** for a race.  
   - Create a `RaceTrack` object and simulate a **multi-lap race** with at least **5 laps**.  
   - Display the **winner and total race results** at the end.  

---

### **Task 4: Enhancing the Simulation with Overtaking Logic**  
Modify the `calculateLapTime` method to **include overtaking chances**:  
- If a car is **within 2 seconds** of the car ahead, it has a chance to **overtake** based on handling.  
- A car with **higher handling** should have a better chance of overtaking.  

üí° **Hint:** Use `Random` to introduce randomness in overtaking chances.

---

### **Example Output:**  
```
Lap 1 begins!
Ferrari F1-75 completed lap in 10.52 seconds.
Red Bull RB18 completed lap in 9.87 seconds.
Mercedes W13 completed lap in 10.10 seconds.
---------------------
Lap 2 begins!
Ferrari F1-75 completed lap in 10.60 seconds.
Red Bull RB18 completed lap in 9.90 seconds.
Mercedes W13 completed lap in 10.21 seconds.
---------------------
...
üèÜ Race Winner: Red Bull RB18 with a total time of 49.23 seconds! üèÜ
```

---

## **Exercise 6: Adding Creativity & Advanced Enhancements üé®**  
Now that we have a **fully working race simulator**, let's take it **one step further** by adding **realism and advanced gameplay mechanics**.

### **Task 1: Implementing Pit Stops ‚õΩ**  
- Introduce **pit stops** where cars **randomly require a stop** to refuel or change tires.  
- A pit stop increases lap time by **5 seconds**, but gives a **5% boost** to acceleration for the next lap.  
- Modify the `calculateLapTime` method to randomly introduce pit stops.  

üí° **Hint:** Use `Random` to decide if a car needs a pit stop (e.g., **10% chance per lap**).  

---

### **Task 2: Introducing Car Upgrades & Damage System üîß**  
- Each car has a **durability score** (e.g., `100` initially).  
- **High speeds and aggressive handling** cause **wear and tear**, reducing durability.  
- If a car‚Äôs durability drops below `50`, **its performance decreases** (handling drops by 10%).  
- Add a **repair system** where cars can repair but lose **3 seconds per repair**.  

üí° **Hint:** Store durability as an attribute in `F1Car` and modify it each lap.  

---

### **Task 3: Implementing a Commentary System üé§**  
- Add **random race events** such as:  
  - "üö® Red Bull RB18 is experiencing engine trouble!"  
  - "üî• Ferrari F1-75 is making an aggressive move to overtake!"  
  - "üåßÔ∏è Rain is getting heavier, reducing all cars' handling!"  
- Use `System
