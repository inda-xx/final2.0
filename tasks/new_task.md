### üéÆ **Task: Create a Simple Game Application**  
**Theme**: Build a simple game application that includes player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. This task will help you integrate key programming concepts such as **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**, **Designing Classes**, and **Programming Creatively**.  

---

### üìö **Exercise 1: Understanding Game Data and File Formats**  
**Objective**: Learn how to read and parse data from files to initialize game objects.  

1. **Description**:  
   In this exercise, you will explore how to read data from a file (e.g., a `.txt` or `.csv` file) and use it to create game objects like players, enemies, and items. The file will contain attributes such as player name, starting position, enemy type, and score thresholds.  

2. **Tasks**:  
   - Study the provided file format (e.g., `game_data.txt`) and identify the data fields.  
   - Write pseudocode to parse the file and extract the necessary data.  
   - Discuss how you would handle exceptions (e.g., missing or corrupted data).  

3. **Scaffolding**:  
   ```java
   // Example file format (game_data.txt)
   // Player:Name,X,Y,Score
   // Enemy:Type,X,Y,Speed
   // Item:Type,X,Y,Value

   // Pseudocode for reading the file
   // 1. Open the file using a FileReader or BufferedReader.
   // 2. Read each line and split it into tokens.
   // 3. Check the first token to determine the object type (Player, Enemy, Item).
   // 4. Extract the remaining tokens as attributes.
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è **Exercise 2: Designing Classes for the Game**  
**Objective**: Design well-structured classes for the game application.  

1. **Description**:  
   In this exercise, you will design classes for the game entities (e.g., `Player`, `Enemy`, `Item`) and define their responsibilities. Focus on creating cohesive classes with clear interfaces and appropriate fields/methods.  

2. **Tasks**:  
   - Identify the responsibilities of each class (e.g., `Player` handles movement, `Enemy` handles interactions).  
   - Define the fields and methods for each class.  
   - Discuss how you would use design patterns (e.g., Singleton for the game manager) to enhance your design.  

3. **Scaffolding**:  
   ```java
   // Example class structure
   class Player {
       String name;
       int x, y;
       int score;

       void move(int deltaX, int deltaY) {
           // Update player position
       }
   }

   class Enemy {
       String type;
       int x, y;
       int speed;

       void interact(Player player) {
           // Handle enemy-player interaction
       }
   }
   ```

### üß© **Exercise 3: Implementing Basic Player Movement**  
**Objective**: Implement player movement using keyboard input.  

1. **Description**:  
   In this exercise, you will implement basic player movement using arrow keys. The player should move within a defined boundary (e.g., a 10x10 grid).  

2. **Tasks**:  
   - Use a loop to continuously check for keyboard input.  
   - Update the player's position based on the input.  
   - Ensure the player does not move outside the grid boundaries.  

3. **Scaffolding**:  
   ```java
   // Example code for reading keyboard input
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   String input = scanner.nextLine();

   // Example movement logic
   if (input.equals("up")) {
       player.move(0, -1);
   } else if (input.equals("down")) {
       player.move(0, 1);
   }
   ```

---

### üéØ **Exercise 4: Adding a Scoring System**  
**Objective**: Implement a scoring system that updates based on player actions.  

1. **Description**:  
   In this exercise, you will add a scoring system to the game. The score should increase when the player collects items or defeats enemies.  

2. **Tasks**:  
   - Define a method to update the player's score.  
   - Trigger score updates when the player interacts with items or enemies.  
   - Display the score on the screen.  

3. **Scaffolding**:  
   ```java
   // Example score update logic
   void collectItem(Item item) {
       player.score += item.value;
   }

   void defeatEnemy(Enemy enemy) {
       player.score += 10; // Example score increment
   }
   ```

---

### üß† **Exercise 5: Implementing Enemy Interactions**  
**Objective**: Add enemy interactions to the game.  

1. **Description**:  
   In this exercise, you will implement enemy interactions. Enemies should move randomly and interact with the player (e.g., reduce the player's score or health).  

2. **Tasks**:  
   - Implement random movement for enemies.  
   - Define interaction logic (e.g., player loses points when colliding with an enemy).  
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., enemies moving outside the grid).  

3. **Scaffolding**:  
   ```java
   // Example random movement logic
   void moveRandomly() {
       int deltaX = (int) (Math.random() * 3) - 1; // Random value between -1 and 1
       int deltaY = (int) (Math.random() * 3) - 1;
       enemy.move(deltaX, deltaY);
   }

   // Example interaction logic
   void checkCollision(Player player, Enemy enemy) {
       if (player.x == enemy.x && player.y == enemy.y) {
           player.score -= 5; // Example penalty
       }
   }
   ```

### üöÄ **Exercise 6: Creative Enhancements and Testing**  
**Objective**: Add creative features and test the game.

2. **Tasks**:  
   - Add at least one creative feature (e.g., power-ups, traps, or multiple levels).  
   - Test the game with peers and gather feedback.  
   - Iterate on your design based on feedback.  

3. **Scaffolding**:  
   ```java
   // Example creative feature: Power-up
   class PowerUp {
       String type;
       int x, y;

       void applyEffect(Player player) {
           if (type.equals("speed")) {
               player.speed += 2;
           }
       }
   }

   // Example testing feedback loop
   // 1. Play the game yourself.
   // 2. Ask a friend to play and observe their experience.
   // 3. Note any issues or suggestions for improvement.

       player.move(0, -1);
   } else if (input.equals("down")) {
       player.move(0, 1);
   } else if (input.equals("left")) {
       player.move(-1, 0);
   } else if (input.equals("right")) {
       player.move(1, 0);
   }

   if (player.x < 0) player.x = 0;
   if (player.x > 9) player.x = 9;
   if (player.y < 0) player.y = 0;
   if (player.y > 9) player.y = 9;

   // Display updated position
   System.out.println("Player position: (" + player.x + ", " + player.y + ")");
   ```
